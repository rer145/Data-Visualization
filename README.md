# Data-Visualization
Repo for DATA 550 at Mercyhurst University, Fall 2017 Term.

## Folder Structure
The ```lectures``` folder contains my notes while following along in the book "Learning Python Data Visualization" by Chad Adams. The examples are primarily a copy of what is in the textbook, with other minor modifications as I mess around.

The ```project-1``` folder contains all the files for Project 1. Within that folder the readme file contains further information.

The ```project-2``` folder contains all the files for Project 2. Within that folder the readme file contains further information.

The ```youtube``` folder contains notes and experiments while following along with YouTube videos.


## Projects

#### Project 1 - IRIS

The purpose of this project was to get familiar with using [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com/) and to work with a real data set. The result was a kernel posted on Kaggle and write up of the code and results.

#### Project 2 - Sleep Data

For this project, we were allowed to select our own data set and perform visualizations with it. I used data from my own life regarding my sleep habits. The data was collected via an app called [Sleep Cycle](https://www.sleepcycle.com/), and the purpose was to again visualize data and write up our conclusions.
