# Data-Visualization
Repo for DATA 550 at Mercyhurst University, Fall 2017 Term.

## Folder Structure
The ```book``` folder contains my notes while following along in the book "Learning Python Data Visualization" by Chad Adams. The examples are primarily a copy of what is in the textbook, with other minor modifications as I mess around.

The ```project-1``` folder contains all the files for Project 1. Within that folder the readme file contains further information.

The ```project-2``` folder contains all the files for Project 2. Within that folder the readme file contains further information.

The ```youtube``` folder contains notes and experiments while following along with YouTube videos.
